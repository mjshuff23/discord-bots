- Run the bot in development: `npm run dev`

## Packages Used

1. `discord.js` - Necessary to a Discord Bot
2. `dotenv` - Necessary to load environment variables (our token)
3. `nodemon` - Necessary to run the bot in development
4. `@types/node` - TypeScript definitions for Node.js

## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to create a Discord bot using TypeScript. The bot will be able to respond to commands and do other cool things.  I have a variety of bots I have written prior to this. I will likely try to retro-fit everything I've done in the past into this project.
